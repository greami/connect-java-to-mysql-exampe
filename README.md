Hi,<br>
This is an example how to link java Classes to mysql.<br>
I workerd in a jpa project using maven.<br>
The main idea:<br>
There is a Student with a list of Mark  (as we usualy do in java) but this time we want to save it on mysql db.
Before to do this i create the database in mysql and i linked the project with the database, IMPORTANT i haven't create anytable they will be created automatically<br>
I worked on netbeans with maven, i used a mysql database on xampp.<br>

In case of question ask to me!<br>
